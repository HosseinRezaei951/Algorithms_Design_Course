# Algorithms Design Course

Welcome to the Algorithms Design Course repository. This repository contains coursework, projects, and special exercises related to algorithms and their design.

## Directory Structure

### Projects

The `Projects` directory includes practical implementations and exercises:

#### Backtrack_Connect_Four_Game

- **Backtrack_Connect_Four_Game.cpp**: Implementation of the Connect Four game using a backtracking algorithm for the PCâ€™s logic. The game allows players to compete against a computer opponent that uses intelligent move selection based on backtracking.

- **README.md**: Documentation detailing the Connect Four game, the backtracking algorithm used, and instructions on how to compile and run the game.

### Specials

The `Special` directory contains additional programs for special topics and advanced algorithms:

- **Closest_Pair.py**: Python implementation of an algorithm to find the closest pair of points among a set of points. This algorithm is often used in computational geometry and has various applications.

- **Knights_Shortest_Path.cpp**: C++ implementation of an algorithm to find the shortest path for a knight on a chessboard from a start position to a target position. This problem can be solved using graph traversal techniques such as Breadth-First Search (BFS).
